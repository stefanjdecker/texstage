# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.2.1.dev0 candidate

- Normalize inline activity references and seeds to LF line endings across
  LaTeX versions, preserving indentation, comments and literal escape sequences.
- Reload lecturer keys after an atomic file replacement even when its timestamp
  matches the cached file, including same-size key renewals.

- Converted the manuals and references to portrait LaTeX articles with serif
  text, continuous sections, multipage tables and wrapped code.
- Unified the downloadable manual PDF and native LaTeX build, preserving all
  presenter and phone screenshots.

- Added a source-reviewed LaTeX package/command reference to the shared manual,
  a standalone reference page, compiled authoring examples and CI coverage checks.

- Extracted the standalone runtime, server, browser assets and four generic styles.
- Added the supported lazy `texstage.api` facade for companion integrations.
- Added hashed runtime/build/development locks, CI, source-archive rebuild checks
  and an installed-wheel smoke check.
- Added installation, development, contribution and release documentation.
- Added an illustrated user manual in Markdown and PDF, 19 screenshots of a
  synthetic session, a runnable manual demo, and locked PDF build dependencies.
- Added an editable LaTeX edition of the same manual, with shared screenshots,
  standalone latexmk build instructions and a CI compilation check.

This candidate has not been published. DBIS styles and course commands are owned
by the companion lecture-tools project. Publication rights for retained developer
utilities and hosted/platform validation remain release prerequisites.
